Jack of all trades, master of none and all that nonsense. But programming is a field where an overly developed sense of curiosity is a basic requirement just to remain relevant.

After Harbin taught me what cold really means, I headed over to Japan where I lived off of ramen and Pocky for 3 years (yes, I know you're likely weeping with jealousy right now). In Tokyo, I attended the Communication Studies program at Temple University in Tokyo, Japan. Though I had intended to become a journalist, I quickly became more interested in how information was being presented than in the information itself.</p>\r\n        <p>Aside from the aspects of multimedia journalism that initially caught my attention, the main draw of programming for me was the need to continuously learn and grow.</p>\r\n      </section>\r\n    </Layout >\r\n  )\r\n};\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
